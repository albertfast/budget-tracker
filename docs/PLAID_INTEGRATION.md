# Plaid Integration Setup

## Overview
The SmartBudget app now includes secure bank account integration using Plaid. This allows users to connect their bank accounts and automatically sync transactions.

## Components Created

### 1. PlaidConnection Component
**File:** `mobile/src/components/PlaidConnection.tsx`

A secure bank connection component that:
- Creates Plaid Link tokens through the backend
- Displays security information and benefits
- Handles the Plaid Link flow
- Provides error handling and retry functionality
- Shows bank-level security features

### 2. Enhanced ConnectAccountScreen
**File:** `mobile/src/screens/ConnectAccountScreen.tsx`

Updated to include:
- Plaid connection option (recommended)
- Alternative manual connection (fallback)
- Proper token exchange handling
- Success/error state management

### 3. AuthService
**File:** `mobile/src/services/authService.ts`

A simple authentication service that:
- Manages JWT tokens
- Provides authenticated request helpers
- Includes mock authentication for development
- Handles authorization headers

## Backend Integration

The integration uses existing backend endpoints:
- `POST /api/banks/link/create-token` - Creates Plaid Link tokens
- `POST /api/banks/link/exchange-token` - Exchanges public tokens for access tokens
- `GET /api/banks/accounts` - Retrieves connected accounts
- `POST /api/banks/accounts/{id}/sync` - Syncs account transactions

## Security Features

### Plaid Security
- Bank-level 256-bit SSL encryption
- Read-only access to accounts
- No storage of banking credentials
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- Encrypted data transmission

### App Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Encrypted storage of access tokens
- Secure token exchange process
- Error handling and logging

## Usage Flow

1. **User opens Connect Account screen**
2. **Plaid Connection (Recommended)**
   - User clicks "Connect with Plaid"
   - PlaidConnection component loads
   - Backend creates Link token
   - User completes Plaid Link flow
   - Public token exchanged for access token
   - Accounts created in database
3. **Alternative Manual Connection**
   - User selects bank provider
   - Enters credentials manually
   - Less secure but available as fallback

## Development Setup

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Backend (.env)
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id
PLAID_SECRET=your_plaid_secret
PLAID_ENV=sandbox  # or development/production
```

### Testing
- Uses Plaid Sandbox environment for development
- Mock authentication for demo purposes
- Simulated success/error flows

## Next Steps

1. **Production Setup**
   - Configure production Plaid credentials
   - Implement real authentication system
   - Add proper error tracking
   - Set up monitoring and alerts

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Real-time transaction webhooks
   - Account balance monitoring
   - Automatic categorization
   - Spending insights and budgets

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Token rotation
   - Enhanced encryption
   - Audit logging
   - Compliance monitoring
